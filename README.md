## 🧩 Files

```text
/                   ← Root directory
├── index.html       ← Main UI
├── style.css        ← Stylesheet
├── main.js          ← JavaScript logic + OCR integration
└── /images          ← UI assets (icons, demos, etc.)
```

## ⚙️ Setup
Option 1: Open locally
Double-click index.html in your browser.

Option 2: Serve from a local web server
bash
Copy

```
# Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000
open http://localhost:8000
```
## 🧠 How It Works
main.js:
- Handles image upload via drag‑drop or file input.
- Reads file with FileReader.
- Runs OCR using Tesseract.js.
- Outputs recognized text into the UI.

Note: OCR occurs entirely in the browser—no back-end needed.

## 🛠️ Customize
- Tweak tesseract.js options (e.g., language, worker count, OCR configurations).
- Enhance UX: add loading indicators, progress bar.
- Support more file formats (PNG, TIFF, PDFs, etc.).

## ✅ Dependencies
- Tesseract.js (via CDN or NPM)
- Modern web browser with ES6 support

## 🚧 Troubleshooting
- No text output? Try clear, high-contrast images.
- OCR errors? Clean image (rotation, noise removal), choose correct OCR language.
- Slow performance? Large images may lag—consider resizing them before OCR.
